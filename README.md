# Time Constant Estimation on a Low-Cost, Low-Power Microcontroller Using the Matrix Pencil Method

Kelly L. Tou, Titan Yuan, Kristofer S. J. Pister

The Matrix Pencil Method (MPM) is implemented on the Single-Chip Micro Mote (SCμM), a low-power, crystal-free, wireless system-on-chip for microrobotic and IoT applications. The SCμM features an on-chip 10-bit SAR ADC, an ARM Cortex M0 microprocessor, 64 kB of data and instruction memory each, and a 2.4 GHz transceiver.
